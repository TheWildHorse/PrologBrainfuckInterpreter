# Brainfuck Interpreter Written in Prolog

This interpreter will let you run any valid Brainfuck code by using the *interpret/1* predicate. (Example: `interpret(",[>+<-]>.").`)  

It uses SWI-Prolog and stores the state as facts so you can see the values of the memory strip and the pointer while/after execution.

Part college obligations, part insanity. ;)
